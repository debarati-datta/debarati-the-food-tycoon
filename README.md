<h1 align="center">Debarati - The Food Tycoon</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://debarati-datta.github.io/debarati-the-food-tycoon/)

**This is the website for a new package holiday coampany that offers just one package right now to test markets. It is a package tour of 6 popular destinations in central India covered in 6 days.**

## Madhya Pradesh - The heart of India - Introduction

### The idea stems from the overall need for people to travel and explore new places. It also recognises that people want the logistics to be taken care of completely so they can just relax and enjoy their break. Hence the package that takes care of food, transport and stay and the visits are neatly scheduled. It is targetted at domestic travellers although some tweaking can make it relevant for international travellers too.

## User Experience (UX)

### User stories

1. The 'itinerary' page allows the user to request an itinerary via email. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/97141782-4f99b880-1757-11eb-9770-e22140c3383d.png)
2. The itinerary takes into account the dates of visit and the number of visitors to create a detailed plan with pricing, payment method etc.


### Site owner goals

### Goal 1 : To offer a visually appealing page to get people interested in the package tour

 1. The Home section presents a beautiful slideshow of six pictures for the six most popular destinations of Madhya Pradesh.
 2. The Home page also presents enticing pictures of the centrally loacted hotel and the food making the idea of picking this holiday stronger in user's mind.
 
 ### Goal 2 : To offer some interactive elements so the user stays longer on the site that results in a booking

1. The map offers interactivity and the user can alter the way the map displays information by clicking on the markers.
2. Also the user can enter some of his details to request a detailed itinerary.

### Goal 3 : To eventually make this as an offering on the major [state tourism website](http://www.mptourism.com/)

1. The state encourages smaller entrepreneurs to present their small sized, specific offering through the main state tourism website 
2. It's an ideal marriage as user is drawn to the large platform but also wants to enjoy the dedicated efforts of smaller teams


## Features

1. The holiday package is all inclusive and provides opportunity to add more destinations within a given radius through 
    research, details of which are made available when requested an itinerary.

2. The google map showing destinations and hotel gets the plan to crystallise in the user's mind.


## New Features to be implemented in future

A booking/payment page that shows dates availability so a booking can be made straightaway by paying up. Terms and conditions page to be 
attached to it showing cancellation and refund policies. Also adding more destinations and giving the user option to build his own tour 
package.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator and JSHint Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/96328537-09987280-103c-11eb-85ce-c8356e3ca49e.png)

        2. [Result : Map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/97307937-362c6580-1858-11eb-8d9c-8d79bfdb75b3.png)


### Further Testing
**Browser testing**

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.

**Device testing**
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung Galaxy Note9, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A good amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.


**Itinerary Request Form: Testing**
1.  Go to the "Request an Itinerary" page
2.  Try to submit the empty form - a prompt message about the required fields appears.
3.  Try to submit the form with an invalid email address - a prompt message appears.
4.  Try to submit the form with number of adults less than 1 - a prompt msg appears.
5.  Try to submit the form with number of children less than 0 - a prompt msg appears.
6.  The form only accepts dates starting from 01.11.2020 to 31.12.2022. Not that that is too helpful but still keeps the user from picking insane dates and allows the site owner to initiate a dialogue.

**EMail sending Testing**
*Once the form is submitted correctly, an email is sent to the site owner in a pre-designed template*
-   [Form Submit]![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/97144344-2f202d00-175c-11eb-979e-b5cc10db1401.png)
-   [EMail Sent]![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/97144440-5840bd80-175c-11eb-98a0-eb28d2b98af5.png)


## Learnings

-   After learning, HTML/CSS, JavaScript felt like a mountain I will not be able to get past. I started working on this project almost simultaneously as 
    I started learning JavaScript only because I thought any idea that may seem implementable, I must do it straightaway. I made this decision quite early 
    only because I was finiding JavaScript too tough and was not sure how much I will retain in my head. I feel I made the right choice as by doing this 
    I never got too overwhelmed as I developed this project very very slowly. It took me days to wrap my head around the simplest of codes like the
    slideshow! I am pleased that I now at least fully understand the code I have implemented in this project, be it for the accordion or the Email sending. 
    Map tooks me ages to implement as my infowindows just won't work but when it finally did, it was a Eureka moment indeed!

-   Researching the internet to find the right guidance was something that I learnt and started relying upon heavily during this project. 

-   At the same time, I learnt how much more JavaScript can do and also learnt the limitations of HTML

## Limitations

-   The form validation uses the code institute's formdump which is not ideal. I wanted to use JS code to validatethe form but need to experiment a lot more to be able to do that. Unfortunately in this instance I took the easy route but it is on my agenda to learn form validation from scratch and I have initiated that already. 
-   The Commit messages do not have the same voice throughout. Somewhere along the journey, I started using the 'past participle' and I dont think I can amend them. But based on my mentor's feedback, I changed commit messages to 'simple present' verb first sentences.

## Known bugs

-   While inspecting, sometimes, the accordion content starts to overlap and top content hides behind the bottom content as you keep dragging the screen inwards making it smaller but when you reload the page, its all fine again. Could not figure why that would happen.

## Deployment

-   Remaining content was written by the developer.

### Media

-   All Images were obtained from the internet and renamed.

### Acknowledgements

-   I thanks my Mentor for continuous helpful feedback. Its my mentor's challenges that I try to live upto. He pointed out in our first project
    meeting that I was still operating in my HTML/CSS cocoon and that helped me explore a lot more.

-   I thank Tutor support especially Miklos who helped me understand the slideshow code via a screen share session. That session helped me in 
    many ways as I started to keenly follow what the code does in a step by step manner. He helped me use the debugger and also just
    taught me the general approach to JavaScript coding. 

- I thanks the slack community as a lot of whys get answered there. Especialy Eventyret_mentor, Eamonn_lead and Mr Bim_alumni who helped me on a number of occassions.
