<h1 align="center">Debarati-The Food Tycoon</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://debarati-the-food-tycoon.herokuapp.com/)

**This is the website for a recipe collection of basic indian regional favourites. Anyone can become a user and add to the collection.**

## Debarati - The Food Tycoon - Introduction

### The idea stems from looking at the the popularity of indian curries and creating a platform for people to add their own recipes. Many dishes with the same name and basic ingedients are cooked in slightly different ways in different parts of India and in order to accomodates this variety, the website has catagories representing different states of the country. 

## User Experience (UX)

### User stories

- ### User 1 : I want to understand in one quick glace the purpose of the site

 1. The callout section clearly spells out the purpose of the site.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/112591232-f912d200-8dfb-11eb-93b9-f4f93678fe7e.png)
 2. Also the very first paragraph on the home page describes the purpose of the website. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/112591385-2fe8e800-8dfc-11eb-8670-05f40c6e6021.png)


- ### User 2 : I want to navigate with ease and find thing easily

 1. The user is greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar that allows you to go to the page of your choice. 
 2. The most relevant information is immediately available with the 'Recipes' and 'New Recipe' sections on the home page.

 - ### User 3 : I want to add my own recipes and have them sit in the database with my name on it

1. The add recipe tab opens up a form that takes in your input in a certain format. 
2. Upon submission, the recipe gets stored in the database with your initials displaying. It also allows you to amend and delete your own recipe when you log in with the same credentials as you used while creating the recipe.

- ### User 4 : I want to add my own recipe as a video

1. The add recipe section allows you to add a video link. This can be your own video or something available on youtube.

### Site owner goals

### Goal 1 : To offer a visually appealing page to get people interested in the recipes

 1. The home page offers a beautiful banner with indian spices displayed
 2. The home page also shows a lot of recipes with a search function at the top which will only get better with time and more and more people contributing recipes.
 
 ### Goal 2 : To offer some interactive elements so the user stays longer on the site that results in adding more recipes to the page

1. The "Add Recipe" page allows people to add their own recipes and upon submitting also flashes a "success" message
2. The "Edit" button on the home page allows users to later add or delete their own content what they previously entered which makes the site quite interactive.



## Features

1. The website feature of adding, editing and deleting your own recipes makes it easy for the user to own the idea and keep coming back to it.

2. The feature of adding a video link to the recipe allows users to create their very own video clip and using it for their recipe via youtube


## New Features to be implemented in future

Ideally, I would like to add quite a few features to it namely :

1. The option to like/love others recipes and add comments for each recipe. that will truly make it a very interactive website which members would love.

2. The option to add more info about each member so the users can connect with other users more on a one to one basis to exchange ideas on cooking

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator and JSHint Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/96328537-09987280-103c-11eb-85ce-c8356e3ca49e.png)
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/96328597-c1c61b00-103c-11eb-9ab5-00adb70eef9c.png)

        2. [Result : Map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/97307937-362c6580-1858-11eb-8d9c-8d79bfdb75b3.png)


### Further Testing
**Browser testing**

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.

**Device testing**
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung Galaxy Note9, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A good amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.


**New Recipe Form: Testing**
1.  Go to the "Request an Itinerary" page
2.  Try to submit the empty form - a prompt message about the required fields appears.
3.  Try to submit the form with an invalid email address - a prompt message appears.
4.  Try to submit the form with number of adults less than 1 - a prompt msg appears.
5.  Try to submit the form with number of children less than 0 - a prompt msg appears.
6.  The form only accepts dates starting from 01.11.2020 to 31.12.2022. Not that that is too helpful but still keeps the user from picking insane dates and allows the site owner to initiate a dialogue.

**EMail sending Testing**
*Once the form is submitted correctly, an email is sent to the site owner in a pre-designed template*
-   [Form Submit]![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/97144344-2f202d00-175c-11eb-979e-b5cc10db1401.png)
-   [EMail Sent]![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66360068/97144440-5840bd80-175c-11eb-98a0-eb28d2b98af5.png)


## Learnings

-   After learning, HTML/CSS, JavaScript felt like a mountain I will not be able to get past. I started working on this project almost simultaneously as 
    I started learning JavaScript only because I thought any idea that may seem implementable, I must do it straightaway. I made this decision quite early 
    only because I was finiding JavaScript too tough and was not sure how much I will retain in my head. I feel I made the right choice as by doing this 
    I never got too overwhelmed as I developed this project very very slowly. It took me days to wrap my head around the simplest of codes like the
    slideshow! I am pleased that I now at least fully understand the code I have implemented in this project, be it for the accordion or the Email sending. 
    Map tooks me ages to implement as my infowindows just won't work but when it finally did, it was a Eureka moment indeed!

-   Researching the internet to find the right guidance was something that I learnt and started relying upon heavily during this project. 

-   At the same time, I learnt how much more JavaScript can do and also learnt the limitations of HTML

## Limitations

-   The form validation uses the code institute's formdump which is not ideal. I wanted to use JS code to validatethe form but need to experiment a lot more to be able to do that. Unfortunately in this instance I took the easy route but it is on my agenda to learn form validation from scratch and I have initiated that already. 
-   The Commit messages do not have the same voice throughout. Somewhere along the journey, I started using the 'past participle' and I dont think I can amend them. But based on my mentor's feedback, I changed commit messages to 'simple present' verb first sentences.

## Known bugs

-   While inspecting, sometimes, the accordion content starts to overlap and top content hides behind the bottom content as you keep dragging the screen inwards making it smaller but when you reload the page, its all fine again. Could not figure why that would happen.

## Deployment

### Content

-   Remaining content was written by the developer.

### Media

-   All Images were obtained from the internet and renamed.

### Acknowledgements

-   I thanks my Mentor for continuous helpful feedback. Its my mentor's challenges that I try to live upto. He pointed out in our first project
    meeting that I was still operating in my HTML/CSS cocoon and that helped me explore a lot more.

-   I thank Tutor support especially Miklos who helped me understand the slideshow code via a screen share session. That session helped me in 
    many ways as I started to keenly follow what the code does in a step by step manner. He helped me use the debugger and also just
    taught me the general approach to JavaScript coding. 

- I thanks the slack community as a lot of whys get answered there. Especialy Eventyret_mentor, Eamonn_lead and Mr Bim_alumni who helped me on a number of occassions.
